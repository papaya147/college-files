From Bangalore
Studied in Isha Home School, Coimbatore
Play volleyball and table tennis

Strengths:
I feel that I'm organised, because I find it hard to work in a messy environment
Engrossed in work when I get it

Weaknesses:
I find it hard to multitask
I lose motivation to work when doing something I don't like

Hobbies include travelling, playing video games and programming which led me to take my course

Studying computer science with spec in data science
One thing I expect from studying in college is to finally implement things I learn in real life
